## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/akramhany/TurboRacer.git
   ```

2. **Assembly using Emulator:**
    Assemble the code using any emulator of your choice. For optimal compatibility, we recommend using the MASM/TASM extension in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Running Modes:**
   - Same Screen Mode: To launch the Same Screen mode, simply run the *Main.asm* file.
   - Dual PC Mode: Run the *Player1.asm* file on one PC, and run the *Player2.asm* on the other one.

**NOTE:** for the Dual PC Mode you would have to link the 2 PCs using an ethernet cable, then configure the connection between them (for more details search on youtube).


## General Guide

1. **Game Modes:**
    - Same Screen: Engage in a shared gaming experience on a single PC, where each player operates with distinct control buttons.
    - Dual PC: Connect to different screens or computers using an Ethernet cable for an extended multiplayer experience.

2. **Controls:**
    - Default Controls: Use the *arrow* keys to move the car, and the *m* key to activate powerups.
    - Same Screen Controls: Player one would use the default controls, and Player two would use *WASD* keys and would activate powerups using *Q* key.

3. **How to Play:**
    - Same Screen Mode: After writing user1 and user2 names then pressing F1 to start the game, pressing the *1* key would generate a random track, then if you want to start the game press *2* key.
    - Dual PC Mode: Due to unforeseen errors, it is necessary to initiate the game in a specific sequence.
        1. The PC running *Player2* file should write his name first then press *enter*, then *Player1* would write his name and also press *enter*.
        2. To start playing, *Player2* would press *F1* first, then *Player1* would press *F1*.
